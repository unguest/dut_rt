        <p>Through time, I've developped some attraction for some technical & non-technical domains.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Since I started learning I.T, I immediately started with programming. From Java to C++ going through Python, I've tried many languages.</p>
        <p>I didn't make a lot of relevant projects but programming teached me how to solve problems with high efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Electronics</h3>
        <p>When it comes to mix science & I.T, electronics and more specifically Arduino are the perfect stuffs to study.</p>
        <p>I've made 2 relevant projects with Arduino :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    Final project for my A level diploma
                </h3>
                <p>
                    By team of 5 persons, we had to solve a problem with Arduino boards, shields & the elctronics skills we gained
                    over the two years. <br>
                    
                    In my team, we had to make a portable, GPS enabled, gas & sound meter.
                    It was supporting the measurement of 5 gases and sound with a precision of 5 to 10 percents. The geolocalisation
                    data binded with the measuremnt's one were stored in a SD card. <br>

                    Finally, an ethernet shield combined with networking librairies automatically were automatically sending these
                    data to a production server for post-measurement processing.
                </p>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    An ESP8266 WiFi deauther
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is an open-source project I've contributed to after using it to learn a bit about management packets on
                    WiFi networks. <br>

                    I've helped to translate the french version of the Web UI and correcting a problem with a button on a specific board.
                </p>

        </ul>


        <h3>
            Cybersecurity
        </h3>

        <p>
            I've started my cybersecurity journey 2 years ago with many pauses & procrastination :p . I'm regularly training myself
            on plateforms like <a href="https://tryhackme.com" target="_blank" class="red-link">TryHackMe</a> or <a href="https://root-me.org" target="_blank" class="red-link">RootMe</a>.

            As I want to become CISO or Pentester later on, I think cybersecurity is the best hobby I have since it links totally with both
            personnal & professionnal interests.
        </p>
